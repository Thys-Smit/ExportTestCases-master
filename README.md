ExportTestCases
===============

Fork of http://exporttfs2excel.codeplex.com

Updated to use TFS 2013 libraries and support more than just static test suites and normal actions.
In theory, it should support any test suite and any child action type.  If it doesn't, open a bug :)

Also has been updated to use a standard file-save dialog, save your settings after a successful export, and support parameterized test cases.
